## The associated features to the team members indicate full stack dev by each member, meaning front-en, back-en, api routes/functions.
## The days of excel sheets and messy word docs that never get passed to the next generation of execs is over, we've built a web-app that allows club admins/founders to create a club, register and manage students, and find interesting information about these students as well, all while creating our own in-house verification process using student IDs.
